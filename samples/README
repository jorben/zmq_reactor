What's Here:
============

Client-Server
-------------
Just a basic client server used to demonstrate other modules

Files:
	main.cpp
	client.*
	server.*


Queue Device
------------
Queue device is an implementation of ZMQ_QUEUE using zmq_reactor.

Files:
	queue_device.cpp
	queue_device.hpp



NB There are no makefiles (yet) because I'm building this on a Mac, so you really don't want my xcodeproj file :-)
