Still a work in progress, but I wanted to get the concepts out 
there so the community could consider it, and improve upon it.

Some rationale:

Doubly linked lists:
- STL lists et al would be hard to manipulate from a handler
- You can derive from a zmq_reactor_t, and manipulate your class 
  from a policy or a handler

Many thanks to [X+1] for allowing me to open source this work.
